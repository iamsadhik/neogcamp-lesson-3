                <h1>Health & Fitness</h1>
                <p class="section-para">   Health is defined as a state of physical, mental, and social well being and not merely physical well being.
                </p>
                <p class="section-para"> To concentrate on ways to be fit, we must understand the reasons for which fitness is required. Our lifestyle has changed by and large, and we are more accustomed to eating out.
                </p> 
                <p class="section-para"> Meals cooked at home are healthier, but our work takes us to different places, and we cannot expect home-cooked meals.
                </p>

                <p class="section-para"> To make up for our lack of eating healthy, we must take proper care of ourselves by exercising regularly. Exercise does not, however, mean that we have to spend our whole day in the gym or we have to give up eating our favorite food.
                </p>
                    
                <p class="section-para"> Most people go for the wrong diet in their struggle to lose weight and stay fit. Following fad diets like eating cabbage soup or onions is not helpful and causes more harm than good. Individuals often skip meals because they think eating less would help them lose weight.</p>
